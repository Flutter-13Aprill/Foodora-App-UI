## Foodora App UI in Flutter 🍔 
### Tuwaiq Academy Flutter Bootcamp

### 📘 Introduction

The goal of this project is to design and implement user interfaces for a Foodora style food delivery app using Flutter. The UI will be built by closely following a reference design provided via Figma [Foodora App Design](https://www.figma.com/design/2zd2h3XEZ7fsSkS3oeSOYn/Food-app---Authentication-(Community)?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=sXtJ8KxNe3voBCvy-0) to practice Flutter development and improve UI design implementation skills.. The focus is on accurately replicating the visual elements and layout to improve UI implementation skills and gain hands-on experience in translating modern food delivery app designs into responsive Flutter interfaces.
